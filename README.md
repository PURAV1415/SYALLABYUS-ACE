# Firebase Studio

This is a Next.js project in Firebase Studio.

## Running the project

To run the development server, you will need two separate terminals.

**Terminal 1: Run the Next.js app**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2: Run the Genkit AI flows**
```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```

Once both are running, open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the application.
